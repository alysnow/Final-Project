It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.",14.319742999999999,/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg,['Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)'],['United States of America'],12/26/1959,212.0,['English'],Released,The entertainment experience of a lifetime.,Ben-Hur,"['roman', 'prince', 'chariot race', 'jerusalem', 'governor', 'politics', 'epic', 'friends', 'revenge', 'jewish', 'galley', 'galley slave']","['Charlton Heston', 'Jack Hawkins', 'Haya Harareet']",['William Wyler'],146900000,11.136,7.7,1101.0,0,1959,12,26,5,12,chariot race epic friends galley galley slave governor jerusalem jewish politics prince revenge roman,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,English,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
